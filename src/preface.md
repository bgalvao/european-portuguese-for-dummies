# Preface

## Motivation

> To give you the tools to learn portuguese on your own, as naturally as possible.

I am writing this book because over the years I've seen my foreign friends struggle with the same hurdles of european portuguese. As someone who is bilingual and been curious about other languages, I think I can break some things down that, to my frustration, no teacher of portuguese ever bothers to explain to foreign students. Things like:

- How we, the portuguese, amalgamate words, e.g. "Mekié?" = "Como é que é?" (_How is it going?_)
- Break down verbal conjugations to the most essential forms.
- To give you a list of keywords to "listen out" for, so you can break down messages more easily.
- Give a foundation to learn from, on your own, based from the experience of listening to other people speaking portuguese.
  - Rather than going to boring classes where you really have to memorize stuff.

I am arrogant in that I am hoping to find a better way to teach portuguese to people who come to Portugal. I have friends who took years to learn portuguese, and I think it relates to the fact that they were not equipped with the right abilities. I am arrogant in that I think I can do better than portuguese teachers. Or at least, give a little push to foreigners to learn the language more easily.

I am selfish in that this is my own little experiment and I hope to inspire native speakers from other languages to write similar guides for my own benefit, as I am interested in learning other languages as well, and I am lazy.

I am trying something different: to write a guide that challenges the usual order of learning.

## Portuguese is one of the easiest languages you can learn as an English speaker

Sure, not the easiest, but at least according to [Babbel](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/easiest-languages-for-english-speakers-to-learn) and [Berlitz](https://www.berlitz.com/blog/easiest-languages-to-learn-for-english-speakers), portuguese is the fith easiest language to learn as an english speaker.

>  The fifth easiest language to learn on our list is Portuguese (...) this translates to a large number of shared vocabulary words, which always makes picking it up easier.

> Like Spanish, Portuguese stems from Latin and uses the same alphabet as the English language, which gives English speakers a slight advantage when learning it.

## A note on brazilian portuguese.

I don't consider it all that bad to learn from brazilian portuguese. Obviously, the accent is different and more open than european portuguese, and the amount of pt-br media present on the internet is much more abundant than that of pt-pt. It is by no surprise: culturally, they are a more open and proactive people than us (when it comes to starting a youtube channel, I think) and they outnumber us by A LOT.

I think that, as long as you know how to decode-encode to/from both accents, you could benefit from adding variety of the media you consume into your learning material.

This book may also be helpful for brazilians looking to get used to how fast we can speak euro portuguese. At least I hope so.

What differs a lot is... Grammar. And that is a big difference that you have to take seriously if you want to speak in euro portuguese. If it becomes of interest, contact me so we can collab on a conversion table between pt-pt and pt-br.
